# Churn-Prediction-Analysis
### The goal is to see if we can predict customer churn. We will perform some visualizations before we go on to pre-process the data, after which we will implement classification models
### Data Processing and Visualization Modules:
#### 1)Numpy
#### 2)Pandas
#### 3)Seaborn
#### 4)Matplotlib
### Machine Learning Modules
#### 1)Train test split
#### 2)Random Forest Classifier
#### 3)Gradient Boost Classifier
#### 4)Ada Boost Classifier
#### 5)MinMaxScaler
#### 6)chi2
#### 7)F1 Score
### Data Cleaning
#### Data cleaning is one of the important parts of machine learning. It plays a significant part in building a model. It surely isn’t the fanciest part of machine learning and at the same time, there aren’t any hidden tricks or secrets to uncover.If we have a well-cleaned dataset, there are chances that we can get achieve good results with simple algorithms also, which can prove very beneficial at times especially in terms of computation when the dataset size is large.
### Outlier Detection
#### Outliers are the values that look different from the other values in the data.Box plots are a visual method to identify outliers. Box plots is one of the many ways to visualize data distribution. Box plot plots the q1 (25th percentile), q2 (50th percentile or median) and q3 (75th percentile) of the data along with (q1–1.5(q3-q1)) and (q3+1.5(q3-q1)). Outliers, if any, are plotted as points left and right the plot.
### Feature Selection Technique
### Pearson correlation for numerical variable
#### Pearson correlation is used to measure how strong the relationship is between two variables.Features with high correlation are mostly Linearley dependent and hence have almost the same effect on the dependent variable. So when two features have a high correlation, we can drop one of the two features.
### Chi Square Test
#### Chi-Square test is a statistical method to determine if two categorical variables have a significant correlation between them.
### Model Building
#### Machine Learning models can be understood as a program that has been trained to find patterns within new data and make predictions. These models are represented as a mathematical function that takes requests in the form of input data, makes predictions on input data, and then provides an output in response.First, these models are trained over a set of data, and then they are provided an algorithm to reason over data, extract the pattern from feed data and learn from those data. Once these models get trained, they can be used to predict the unseen dataset.
### Recommendations
#### Attempt to minimise wait times so that consumers who have had to wait the longest for an order do not churn.
#### Attempt to enhance previous experiences so that clients who are dissatisfied with previous experiences do not churn.
#### You can cut the price of some items or supply various bundles for those customers who cannot afford the service and wish to churn.
#### Customers who prioritise good taste are more likely to churn. As a result, make an effort to improve the excellent teste so that the client does not leave.
#### Customers who have had their meal deliveries delayed want to order more. As a result, attempt to deliver quickly so that the consumer does not leave.
#### Create a healthy environment for customers so that they do not churn.
